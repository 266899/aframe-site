### What's Next?

The core API will stay unstable for the foreseeable future and the library is not yet ready for production use. Future development will focus on the following:

1. Streamlining the developer experience, such as better developer tools.

2. Providing more learning resources, such as tutorials and examples.

3. Improving `aframe` templates to make them production ready.
