It's too hard to make virtual reality web sites. Today we're sharing a tool that makes it easy.

We've been developing it for six months at Mozilla.
We call it A-Frame: Building Blocks for the VR Web.

A-Frame lets anyone create VR web experiences with markup. Users just type simple primitives like `<a-image>`, `<a-model>`, and `<a-sky>`. To create 360° video worlds, interactive 3D models, animated fly throughs… anything they can imagine.

These experiences work anywhere: from an iPhone with a Google Cardboard viewer, to an Oculus Rift with Firefox, to a desktop computer without a VR headset. A-Frame is responsive out-of-the-box.

A-Frame is also deep. It's easy to pick up, but very powerful. A-Frame provides lights, textures, animations, interactions, and much more. And supports scripting. A-Frame elements are just HTML, so developers can use all the traditional JS methods.

To get started with A-Frame, users can…
A community exists at…
They can share their work, get feedback, download new tools, etc…

It's the dawn of the VR web. No one knows what it's going to be yet.
With tools like A-Frame, virtual reality is now something anyone can do, and anyone can experience…
It's a match thrown into a dry field.
Let's start building :)
