### Today the MozVR team releases the first version of A-Frame: an open source framework for creating responsive WebVR experiences with markup.

A-Frame makes it easy for web developers to create WebVR experiences that can be viewed on desktop, mobile, and the Oculus Rift.

We created A-Frame because we wanted to make WebVR development easier. WebVR has shipped in builds of Firefox and Chromium since the summer of 2014, but creating content for it has required knowing WebGL. The WebGL community is unbelievably talented, and has created many mind-blowing WebVR experiences, but they are a small subset of the overall web development community. There are millions of talented web developers who do not know WebGL. What if each of them could create and share WebVR experiences?

A-Frame is designed to be familiar to those web developers. It wraps the power of WebGL in HTML custom elements, so creating a high performance VR experience is as simple as:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframevr.io/releases/latest/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-sky src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/_skies/lake.jpg"></a-sky>
      <a-model src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/showcase-composite/sculpture.dae" position="0 0 -2"></a-model>
      <a-image src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/showcase-composite/portland.png" width="1" height="0.35" position="-2 1.2 1"></a-image>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

A-Frame ships with powerful building block "primitives" for common use cases such as 360-degree videos, images, models, skies. For the full list of primitives included in A-Frame 0.1, see the [A-Frame documentation](../../../../../docs/primitives). Primitives can also be combined with lighting, animation, sound and interactivity. 

A-Frame goes deeper than just primitives, however. For users who need additional control and flexibility, A-Frame provides a series of components for lighting, material, re-usabled assets, and more. This is the A-Frame entity-component system. Based on a pattern common in the game development world, it is the entity-component system that gives A-Frame it's full power and extensibility. 

A-Frame is ultimately just the DOM, so developers can also manipulate it with standard JavaScript methods, such as:

```js
var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
var cube = document.createElement('a-cube');
cube.setAttribute('color', 'red');
scene.appendChild(cube);
```

A-Frame is early. The 0.1 version has several known issues, and the API will change over the next few months as we get feedback and open source contributions. Our hope is that early adopters find it as fun as we do, and join us in forming a new community of creativity, hacking and sharing.
